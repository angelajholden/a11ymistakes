In 2019 and 2020, WebAIM surveyed the homepages for the top 1,000,000 websites and compiled a list of the six most common accessibility mistakes. This guide will illustrate what they are and how to fix them.

1. [Low contrast text](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#1-low-contrast-text)
2. [Missing alternative text for images](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#2-missing-alternative-text-for-images)
3. [Empty links](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#3-empty-links)
4. [Missing form input labels](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#4-missing-form-input-labels)
5. [Empty buttons](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#5-empty-buttons)
6. [Missing document language](https://github.com/angelajholden/a11ymistakes#6-missing-document-language)

### 1) Low contrast text

:bar_chart: 86.3% of homepages in 2020

From the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/):

> WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
>
> Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.

| Contrast Ratio :sparkles: |  AA   |  AAA  |
| :------------------------ | :---: | :---: |
| Normal Text               | 4.5:1 |  7:1  |
| Large Text                |  3:1  | 4.5:1 |
| UI Components             |  3:1  |  NA   |

| Text Size :sparkles:             | Point |  Pixel  |
| :------------------------------- | :---: | :-----: |
| Normal Text (normal font weight) | 12pt  |  16px   |
| Large Text (bold font weight)    | 14pt  | 18.66px |
| Large Text (normal font weight)  | 18pt  |  24px   |

### 2) Missing alternative text for images

:bar_chart: 66% of homepages in 2020

#### Correct - image with alt text

```html
<img
    src="https://picsum.photos/840/472"
    alt="Random placeholder photo from Lorem Picsum"
/>
```

#### Also correct!

Alt text attributes can be included but left empty and screen readers will skip the image. Use this method when an image is decorative and reading the alt text doesn't add value for the user.

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/840/472" alt="" />
```

#### Incorrect - image without alt text

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/840/472" />
```

### 3) Empty links

:bar_chart: 59.9% of homepages in 2020

```html
<a href="https://webaim.org">Web AIM</a>
```

---

### 4) Missing form input labels

:bar_chart: 53.8% of homepages in 2020

Use the `for=""` attribute on the `<label>`, and use a matching `id=""` attribute on its `<input>`.

```html
<label for="name">Full Name</label>
<input id="name" type="text" name="fullname" placeholder="Full Name" />
```

When you want to hide the form label, use screen reader friendly CSS.  
Using `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` removes it from the DOM, and screen readers won't read elements styled that way.

```css
.screen-reader-text {
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
}
```

```html
<label class="screen-reader-text" for="name">Full Name</label>
<input id="name" type="text" name="fullname" placeholder="Full Name" />
```

If you aren't hiding form labels, they can also be wrapped around the form element.

```html
<label for="name"
    >Full Name
    <input id="name" type="text" name="fullname" placeholder="Full Name" />
</label>
```

### 5) Empty buttons

:bar_chart: 28.7% of homepages in 2020

```html
<button>Read More</button>
```

---

### 6) Missing document language

:bar_chart: 28% of homepages in 2020

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

I encourage you to continue reading and learning about accessibilty. This topic goes far beyond what is outlined in this guide. Knowing that 98.1% of the websites surveyed had a detecable error implies that fixing these six things could have a vast improvement on overall web accessibility.
